# Heart-Alert

Heart Alert is a small portable device that reads in an individual’s pulse and alerts you and another person if your heart is working too hard or something more serious occurs. To use, the pulse sensor needs to be wrapped around your finger or wrist and that’s it! Heart Alert will read in the pulse of the user and begin to buzz if the user’s heartbeat is too high or too low. The user then has ten seconds to press a button that notifies Heart Alert that the user is fine. If this button is not pressed within this time frame then Heart Alert will send a text to a doctor or a loved one to inform them that something serious might have occurred with the user.
